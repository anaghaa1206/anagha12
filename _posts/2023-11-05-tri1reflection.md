Introduction to Computer Science: Trimester 1 provided me with a strong foundation in the fundamental concepts of computer science. I learned about algorithms, data structures, and the importance of problem-solving skills. This introductory phase helped me see the broad scope of computer science and its relevance in today's world.

Coding Skills: Throughout the trimester, I gained proficiency in coding, particularly in Python, which is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language. I was able to write, understand, and debug code, which is a crucial skill for any computer science student.

Algorithms and Problem Solving: Trimester 1 helped me appreciate the significance of algorithms and how they are at the core of computer science. I learned to design and analyze algorithms to solve various problems, which enhanced my problem-solving abilities.

Data and Data Structures: I explored the concept of data and the importance of data structures. Understanding data types, variables, and data organization was essential to working with data effectively and efficiently.

Computational Thinking: I developed computational thinking skills, which involve breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. This approach helped me tackle challenging programming tasks with a structured and logical mindset.

Creative Projects: Trimester 1 included opportunities to work on creative projects. These projects not only allowed me to apply what I learned but also encouraged me to think innovatively and independently.

Collaboration and Communication: I had the chance to collaborate with peers on group projects, which taught me the importance of clear communication and teamwork in solving problems and building solutions together.
