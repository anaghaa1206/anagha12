Attending the event was an incredibly enriching experience, one that seamlessly blended entertainment with education. The performances unfolded as a series of dances and skits, each ingeniously designed to represent different algorithms and sorting techniques. This creative approach to showcasing complex concepts was not only engaging but also served as an innovative method of learning. Moreover, the attention to detail in the use of props and attire added a rich layer of authenticity and visual appeal to the performances. Each group had clearly put thought into selecting props that accurately represented the algorithm or sorting method being depicted. For instance, costumes were not merely for show; they were symbolic, with colors and patterns representing different data elements or algorithm functions. Props were used creatively to illustrate concepts such as swapping elements, comparing values, or visualizing data structures.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort works by comparing each element with its predecessors, then moving it to its correct position. It's efficient for small data sets but slows down as the size increases, with a quadratic time complexity.

### Bogo Sort/Quick Sort

Bogo Sort randomly arranges the data until it is sorted. It is highly inefficient and more of a humorous example of how not to sort, with a potentially infinite worst-case scenario.Quick Sort uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting a pivot and partitioning the array around it. It's fast for large datasets, with average and worst-case time complexities.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, pushing smaller elements to the start. Simple but inefficient for large datasets.

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them. Efficient for large datasets due to its consistent time complexity, it uses a divide-and-conquer approach.

These algorithms vary in efficiency and complexity, making some more suited for large datasets (like Quick Sort and Merge Sort) and others better for educational purposes or small datasets (like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort).

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted sublist on the left end and the unsorted sublist on the right. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty, and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list.
