## Tool Setup Review
- First I opened my terminal, and typed 'python --version' to see if my python version was up to date
- Next I checked if VS Code was installed, and I downloaded it from the Teacher's blog and it showed up on my dock
- Git is a tool used to document changes in code, to make sure it was installed, i typed 'gir --version' and it showed 2.41.0, which is good
- Using all these tools I was able to create a repository
