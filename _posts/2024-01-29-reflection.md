We learned about routing and computing, the engines behind our digital world. It's like understanding how messages travel on the internet and how computers process information, making things work smoothly.

Computing can be awesome, bringing people together globally. But it also has a dark side, like cyber threats. We need to be mindful of using technology ethically.

The digital divide is a big issue â€“ not everyone has the same access to technology. Fixing this gap is important for equal opportunities in education and jobs.

We explored biases in algorithms and data, which can reinforce unfair ideas. Fixing these biases means making sure our code treats everyone fairly.

There are still many unsolved problems in computer science, like quantum computing and ethical questions in artificial intelligence. We're on a journey to figure these out.

Crowdsourcing, or working together with many people, is a powerful way to solve big problems. It's like tapping into the collective brainpower to find creative solutions.

As we reflect on these topics, we see that computer science is not just about coding. It's about understanding the digital world and using our skills to make it better for everyone.
